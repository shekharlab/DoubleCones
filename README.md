- **src/**: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step SAMap analysis
- **src/**: Cellpose nuclei segmentation for \emph{in situ} hybridization analysis 
- **src/**: Nuclei counting for \emph{in situ} hybridization analysis 

## Getting Started
To run the analyses, clone this repository and ensure required dependencies are installed. Notebooks require Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shekharlab/DoubleCones.git
cd DoubleCones
