## Repository Structure
- **src/AnalysisAndFigures.Rmd**: R Markdown notebook where most analysis, figures, and supplementary materials were generated.
- **src/SamapAnalysis.ipynb**: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step SAMap analysis
- **src/RunCellpose.ipynb**: Cellpose nuclei segmentation for *in situ* hybridization analysis 
- **src/CountCellPuncta-RedOpsin.ipynb**: Nuclei counting for *in situ* hybridization analysis 

## Getting Started
To run the analyses, clone this repository and ensure required dependencies are installed. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shekharlab/DoubleCones.git
cd DoubleCones
```

## Usage

For raw data needed to run analyses, please email Dario Tommasini or Karthik Shekhar.
